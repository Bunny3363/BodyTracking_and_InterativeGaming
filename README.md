# Real-Time Body Movement Tracking and Interactive Game

This project aims to track body movements in real-time using camera feed and utilize them as input for an interactive game. By leveraging computer vision techniques, the application will detect and analyze body movements, allowing users to control and interact with a game using their body gestures.

## Features

- Real-time body movement tracking using camera feed.
- Gesture recognition and mapping to game controls.
- Interactive gameplay experience using body gestures.
- Support for various games and customizable gestures.
- User-friendly interface and easy setup.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (for gesture recognition)
- Web development framework (e.g., Flask, Django) for game integration
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for web-based game interface

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project.git

2. Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set up the project dependencies and environment.

4. Run the application:
python main.py


## Usage

1. Connect a camera to your computer or use the built-in webcam.

2. Launch the application.

3. Stand in front of the camera and perform the defined gestures to control the game.
